## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Using Flexbox to center a component on the page.
- Using the border-radius property to round box corners in CSS
- Using a Main tag to surround page content
- The necessity of using a CSS Reset
- Writing a alt tag on images for accessibility reasons.
- Font-Size should be in rems instead of px and the default is 16px.
- I learned how to add a custom font and a font-weight.
- Practiced my understanding of the Box Model
- Learned how to use the appropriate HTML Semantic Tags

### Continued development

I would like more Flexbox and Box Model practice. I also need to deepen my understanding on the complexities and use cases for Semantic HTML tags.

### Useful resources

- [Fed Mentor Article on Font-Size](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/font-size-px/) - This helped me because i was still using fixed measurement units like px for font-size instead of using Responsive Units. Learning to use Responsive Units has helped me out immensely.
