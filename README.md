## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
-

### What I learned

- Using Flexbox to center a image on the page.
- Using the border-radius property to round box corners in CSS
- Using a Main tag surrounding page content
- The necessity of using a CSS Reset
- Writing a alt tag for accessibility reasons.
- Font-Size should be in rems instead of px and the default is 16px.
- I learned how to add a custom font and a font-weight.
- Practiced my understanding of the Box Model




### Continued development

I would like more practice with Flexbox. I plan to continue my understanding of the Box Model. I hope to learn how to write more appropriately Semantic HTML code.
